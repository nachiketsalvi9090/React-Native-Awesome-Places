# React Native TypeScript Boilerplate
This is a boilerplate project for working with React Native and TypeScript.

You can copy or reference this repository in order to get started with a React
Native project using a TypeScript source that includes environment variable
configuration, linting, and testing with sensible defaults that align with
Mobiquity's standards for React Native development.

**This documentation is *required reading* for Mobiquity developers starting
out on React Native projects.**

This is intended to be read in order.

* [The base and example apps](doc/example-apps.md)
* [React Native App Setup](doc/setup.md)
* [Dependencies](doc/dependencies.md)
* [Directory and File Structure](doc/fs-structure.md)
* [Configuring, developing, and debugging](doc/development.md)
* [Unit testing and standards](doc/testing.md)

These sections are specifically for tech leads, senior developers, etc. but are
totally open to anyone who wants to read them.
* [Building](doc/building.md)
* [Philosophy](doc/philosophy.md)
